# AI-Scientist: Automated Scientific Research Driven by AI

## Overview

Welcome to AI-Scientist, an open-source initiative focused on revolutionizing scientific research through automation. By harnessing the power of large-language models (LLMs) and other AI modalities, we aim to develop automated frameworks that streamline the research process, improving innovation and efficiency across the scientific spectrum. From literature reviews, hypothesis generation, to experimentation, we aim to develop adaptable and scalable solutions that could drive meaningful scientific progress that benefits society.

## Organization
Currently, the repository is organized by the functionality of the automated agents/frameworks, we propose the following functionality that preoccupies the day-to-day of many scientists' jobs:
- **literature_review:** Summarize key findings, synthesize knowledge, and identify emerging trends.
- **hypothesis_generation:** Leverage data-driven insights and AI models to formulate hypotheses, fostering novel research avenues and accelerating discovery.
- **data_analyses:** Develop and implement machine learning models and statistical tools flexible to adapt to various datasets.
- **results_interpretation:** Interpret results in the context of existing knowledge.
- **peer_review:** Interpret results in the context of existing knowledge.
- **multi_function:** Execute multiple functionalities required in scientific research.
While we envision the eventual AI scientist to be multi-functional, there may be unique advantages to focusing on and evaluating a specific functionality. It is possible and likely that AI-driven scientific processes will differ from human-driven ones (for example, they may not require the same peer review). We shall find out when we get there.
