# AI-Scientist: AI-Driven Scientific Research Automation

## Overview

Welcome to AI-Scientist, an open-source initiative focused on revolutionizing scientific research through automation. By harnessing the power of large-language models (LLMs) and other AI modalities, we aim to develop robust tools and frameworks that streamline the research process, improving innovation and efficiency across the scientific spectrum. From literature reviews, and hypothesis generation, to experimentation, we aim to develop adaptable and scalable solutions that could drive meaningful scientific progress that benefits society.

## Organization

- **Literature Review:** Summarize key findings, synthesize knowledge, and identify emerging trends.
- **Hypothesis Generation:** Leverage data-driven insights and AI models to formulate hypotheses, fostering novel research avenues and accelerating discovery.
- **Data Analyses:** Develop and implement machine learning models and statistical tools flexible to adapt to various datasets.
