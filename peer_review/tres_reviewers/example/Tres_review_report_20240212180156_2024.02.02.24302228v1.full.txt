**Expert 1: Genetic Analysis Expert**

Key Strengths:
- DDx-PRS effectively models the variance/covariance structure across disorders, leveraging case-control PRS and prior clinical probabilities for each diagnostic category.
- Well-calibrated results were obtained in both simulated data and empirical PGC data, showcasing the robustness of the method.
- DDx-PRS outperformed a simpler method (Marginal-PRS) in distinguishing related disorders from each other and controls.

Key Weaknesses:
- The method relies on summary-level training data, which may limit the granularity of the analysis compared to individual-level data.
- The calibration and performance results may vary in real-world clinical settings due to factors not accounted for in the study.
- The projection of clinical utility at larger training sample sizes may be speculative and require further validation in practical applications.

Suggested Improvements:
- Conduct further studies to validate the performance of DDx-PRS in diverse clinical settings and populations.
- Explore the potential impact of incorporating individual-level data to enhance the accuracy and granularity of the analysis.
- Expand the scope of the study to include additional psychiatric disorders or validate the method on larger datasets to assess generalizability.


**Expert 2: Clinical Application Specialist**

Key Strengths:
- DDx-PRS is designed to address the challenge of differential diagnosis for related psychiatric disorders with non-specific symptoms at disorder onset.
- The method provides posterior probabilities for each diagnostic category, offering a quantitative approach to aid clinicians in decision-making.
- The study demonstrates the potential for DDx-PRS to enhance clinical practice by improving diagnostic accuracy, especially for challenging differential diagnoses.

Key Weaknesses:
- The study primarily focuses on genetic data and may not capture the full complexity of clinical presentations and environmental factors influencing psychiatric disorders.
- The clinical utility projections at larger training sample sizes may not fully account for the diverse patient populations and diagnostic scenarios encountered in real-world practice.
- Implementation of DDx-PRS in routine clinical practice may require additional validation and integration with existing diagnostic procedures and guidelines.

Suggested Improvements:
- Collaborate with clinicians and healthcare providers to validate the utility of DDx-PRS in real-world clinical settings and assess its impact on decision-making.
- Consider integrating other data modalities (e.g., clinical assessments, behavioral profiles) to enhance the accuracy and applicability of DDx-PRS in clinical practice.
- Conduct prospective studies to evaluate the usability, feasibility, and patient outcomes related to the implementation of DDx-PRS in routine psychiatric care.


**Expert 3: Data Science and Machine Learning Specialist**

Key Strengths:
- DDx-PRS leverages advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques to model the variance/covariance structure across genetic data of psychiatric disorders.
- The method demonstrates effective calibration and discriminative performance in distinguishing related disorders, showcasing the robustness of the approach.
- By offering posterior probabilities for each diagnostic category, DDx-PRS provides interpretable outputs that can guide clinical decision-making and improve differential diagnosis accuracy.

Key Weaknesses:
- The reliance on summary-level training data and the assumptions made in the modeling process may introduce biases and limitations that could impact the generalizability of the results.
- The method's computational complexity and resource requirements could be challenging for practical implementation in clinical settings with limited resources or expertise in genetic analysis.
- The study could benefit from additional benchmarking against alternative machine learning models or ensemble methods to further validate the superiority of DDx-PRS in differential diagnosis.

Suggested Improvements:
- Develop explainable AI techniques to enhance the interpretability of DDx-PRS results for clinicians and researchers without a strong background in genetics or machine learning.
- Explore strategies to optimize the computational efficiency of DDx-PRS without compromising its predictive accuracy, making it more accessible for widespread use in clinical practice.
- Collaborate with interdisciplinary teams to validate DDx-PRS on diverse datasets and refine the method to address specific clinical needs and challenges encountered in psychiatric differential diagnosis.
