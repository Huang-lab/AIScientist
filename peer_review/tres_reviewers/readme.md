# Tr√®s Reviewers: Manuscript Review and Improving Assistant

## Introduction

The Manuscript Review Assistant isdesigned to automate the initial review and improvement of manuscripts using the OpenAI GPT API. It processes manuscripts in PDF or DOCX format, extracts text content and generates a review report by querying the GPT API.

Key Insight: Rather provide a singular review from one point of view, Tres Reviewers identify three reviewers of different expertise areas, like human-centric peer-review process, can provide more specific expert insights that can better judge and help improve the manuscript.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyPDF2
- python-docx
- python-dotenv
- OpenAI Python SDK

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.6 or higher is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository or download the source code to your local machine.

3. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install PyPDF2 python-docx python-dotenv openai
   ```

## Configuration

1. Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your manuscript files (PDF or DOCX) in a convenient directory.

2. Run the Manuscript Review Assistant from the terminal. When prompted, enter the full path to the manuscript file you wish to review (replace the example file):

   ```bash
   python python3 tres_reviewers.py

   Enter the path of the manuscript (PDF or DOCX): example/2024.02.02.24302228v1.full.pdf
   ```

3. The tool will process the manuscript, query the GPT API for a review, and generate a review report in the same directory as the manuscript file, named `Tres_review_report_<timestamp>_<original_filename>.txt`.
